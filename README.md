This repository contains a Solidity smart contract with a vulnerability in its ownership transfer function and the solution to fix this bug. The original contract lacks a check to ensure that only the current owner can transfer ownership. This can be exploited by malicious actors to transfer ownership without authorization.  The solution addresses this vulnerability by adding the necessary ownership check.
